	(version 0.6-2)

	(Wed Feb  9 22:51:36 2011)
	Use  single quotes (not double quotes) around sheet name in
	ssconvert --export-range="'Sheet1'!A1:Z100"
	ssconvert 1.10.13 appears to require this.
	Also:  use double quotes (not single) around "filename.gnumeric",
	otherwise file not found. Windows does not understand single quotes?

	(version 0.6-1)

	(Thu Sep  2 08:58:24 2010)
	'grep ,' workaround to exclude diagnostic messages from
	ssconvert's standard output removed

	Value returned by Sys.which() tested with file.exists

	read.gnumeric.sheet adds double quotes around sheet name for
	ssconvert. This should allow reading from sheets with spaces and
	hyphens in their names.

	(version 0.5-3)

	(Tue Sep 1 11:23:35 2009) under unix, use 'LANG=C ssconvert' to
	avoid decimal comma instead of decimal dot in ssonvert output
	under e.g. hungarian locale

	(Thu Sep 17 00:20:17 2009) add gnumeric.xml.read.sheet.names,
	gnumeric.xml.read.sheet.info, gnumeric.xml.read.sheets. Now depends on
	package XML
