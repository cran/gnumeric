Description: Read data files readable by 'gnumeric' into 'R'. Can read
        whole sheet or a range, from several file formats, including
        the native format of 'gnumeric'. Reading is done by using
        'ssconvert' (a file converter utility included in the 'gnumeric'
        distribution <http://www.gnumeric.org>) to convert
        the requested part to CSV. From 'gnumeric' files (but not other
        formats) can list sheet names and sheet sizes or read all
        sheets.
